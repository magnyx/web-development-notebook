Notes referring to the study of Computer Science, from TheOdinProject.

  Notes from the Webdeveloper Foundations Course by The Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/)

Foundations Course: 
1- Internet, Computer basics
2- Git, GitHub basics
3- Front-end technologies basics (HTML, CSS, Javascript)

Introduction: The Odin Project is an open-source community dedicated to providing the best information sources to take you from zero to (hero) full-stack developer.
Don't skip anything.

##  Web development
Introduction: Web developers build and maintain websites.
Clients usually are trying to get their product or service onto the wbe. The work is usually project-focused and involves collaborating with a team to coordinate the client's needs into the end product. The work could involve front-end, back-end ou full-stack web development.

Front end development: the stuff you see on the website in your browser, including the presentation of content ans user interface elements. HTML, CSS, Javascript etc.
Back end development: the guts of the application, which live on the server. Stores and serves program data to ensure that the front end has what it needs. Can become complicated when a website has millions of users. Java, Python, Roby and Javascript to work with data.
Full-stack developers are comfortable workinf with both the front and back ends. This is the focus of The Odin Project, to cover all aspects of web development.

Tools to use regularly: Computer, Google, Text Editor, Command Line Interface (CLI), Stack Overflow, Git, GitHub

Reading assignment: "Why Learning Code is so damn hard" (https://web.archive.org/web/20230630111131/https://www.thinkful.com/blog/why-learning-to-code-is-so-damn-hard/); Wikipedia's take on Web design (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design); and the blog post from Udacity on front-end, back-end and full stack developers (https://www.udacity.com/blog/2020/12/front-end-vs-back-end-vs-full-stack-web-developers.html).
From these, the most important observations I've found were: 
 1. Learn the basic, and build. Once facing challenges upon, try to collab. Also, always learn from other people's codes on your own. Embrace challenges and don't give up.
 2. Creating a website involves: web designer, web development. But it can (and should) also involve a Graphic designer (logos, layouts, buttons), Internet marketing specialist, SEO writer, Internet copywriter, and User experience (UX) designer. These are all important in the making of an effective website!
 3. For front-end web development, must learn HTML, CSS and Javascript. Also, must be proficient in web frameworks and libraries like Bootstrap, Foundation, AngularJS, ReactJS, and EmberJS. Node.js is also a powerful tool and enhances workflow when using frameworks like ReactJS and AngularJS. Then, must also acquire experience with Ajax (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML). Also, the front-end developer must have a keen eye to detail and creativity.
3.1 Back-end development of a website consists of a server, an application, and a database. To make the server, application, and database communicate, we use languages like Node.js, Go, PHP, Ruby, Python, Java, and .NET. Can also use tools like MySQL, Oracle, and SQL Server to find, save, or change data and serve it back to the user through front-end code. 
Python is favored for its readability and simplicity -> repid development. Java is renowned for its performance and scalability -> ideal for large-scale enterprise applications.
Jobs for back-end developers often require experience with PHP frameworks like Laravel, Symfony, and CakePHP; version control software like Git; and using Linux as development and deployment system. Knowledge on these tools allow back-end developers to create robust, scalable, secure web applications.
3.2 Full stack developers are a jack-of-all-trades. The term was popularized by Facebook's engineering department. They're a full package.

Reading suggestions I caught were:
Hacker news (https://web.archive.org/web/20230630111115/https://news.ycombinator.com/)
[Book] Homepage usability: 50 websites deconstructed (https://archive.org/details/homepageusabilit00jako_0/mode/2up). According to wikipedia, the authors of this book sustain that the homepage of a website is the most important page (2002). Other web developers contest, arguing that most people go straight to the page they intend to through searching engines. But the book looks really cool still!

## Learning to Learn
The brain has two "core" modes: the focus mode and the relaxed mode. Navigate through "focus" and "relaxed" mode in a fluid way so you can learn!

  How to Ask for help
When asking a question, always provide as much information as possible:
1. Your code
2. The error message
3. Terminal command
4. Server output
5. Other relevant details
6. Ask specifically about the problem, not the solution. 
  E.g. Instead of "How do I complete Step 5 of Rock Paper Scissors Assignment?", ask "Hey, I’m trying to return a string that displays the winner in Rock Paper Scissors, but I’m getting a syntax error on line 12. How can I fix this? Here’s my code.”
PS: When it's needed to provide a code that is too long, use CodePen (HTML/CSS/Javascript), Replit (Javascript/Ruby), CodeSandbox(Webpack/React), Pastebin (for error messages or server output).
PS1: If there's a question before you're written any code, provide your pseudo code. 
PS2: After succesfully solving a difficult problem with help, try writing about it on the README.md file of the project yo'ure working on
PS3: Still have doubts? Read https://www.theodinproject.com/guides/community/how_to_ask
PS4: Avoid de XY Problem (https://xyproblem.info/)

  The XY Problem is asking about your attempted solution rather than your actual problem. 
  -  User want to do X.
  -  Doesn't know, but thinks they can do it through Y
  -  User asks about Y
  -  Confusion.
  The solution is to always include information about a broader picture along with the attempted solution.

  Formatting questions
If having trouble on the command line, make sure to include both your input and the error message.
In chat rooms, code can be displayed differently from normal sentences by using backsticks (''), so:
  For a single line of code: one backstick before and after the code. 
    'Your code'
  For multiple lines of code: three backsticks on a separate line above and below the code:
    '''
    Code
    '''
  You can also use code highlighting to add color to you multi-line code by specifying the language:
    '''js or JavaScript
    Multiple lines of code
    '''

## What is a Computer

A computer is an electronic device that manipulates information, or data. It has the ability to store, retrieve, and process data.

Hardware is any physical parts of the computer, for example the mouse and headset. It also includes the internal parts, such as HD, SSD, motherboard etc.
Software is any set of instructions that tells hardware what to do and how to do it. Without software, the hardware is void and doesn't work.
Every computer needs both hardware and software to function.

Types of computers:
Personal computer: typically composed by computer case, monitor, keyboard and mouse.
Laptop computer: typically composed by a one-serves-all case, which is the whole computer itself.
Tablet computer: even samller version on an entire computer in one set, always has touch-sensitive screen function.
Server: it's a computer that serves up information to other computers on a network. For example, things that you find on the Internet are typically sotres in a server. Many businesses also use local file servers to store and share files internally.

A new perspective: many of today's electronics are basically speccialized computers, though we don't always think of them that way. It's the case of:
  Smartphones: browse the Internet and play games;
  Wearables (fitness trackers and smartwatches): designed to be worn, specific functions;
  Game consoles: playing video games, usually on a TV;
  TVs: many TVs nowadays include applications which connects them to the Internet.

PCs(1981) and Macs(1984)
The war is endless

Parts of a computer:
Computer case (a "tower case" is a type of computer case): is the metal and plastic box that contains the main components of the computer, including the motherboard, central processing unit (CPU), and power supply. The front of the case usually has an On/Off button and one or more optical drives.
Monitor: works with a video card, located inside the computer case, to display images and text on the screen. Nowadays, mostly LCD (liquid crystal display) or LED (light-emitting diode) displays.Older monitors use CRT (cathode ray tube) displays.
Keyboard: wireless or ergonomic
Mouse: It is commonly known as a pointing device and allows you to point, click and move objectts on screen. There are two types, the optical (detects movement using a optical sensor at the bottom) and the mechanical mouse (uses a rolling ball to detect movement and requires regular cleaning to work properly).  There are some mouse alternatives such as a trackball and a touchpad.
Power cord

Peripherals:
Printers: used to print documents, photos etc. There are many types, such as inkjet, laser and photo printers. Also, all-in-one-printers, which can also scan and copy documents.
Scanner: copy a physical image or document and save to your computer as a digital (computer-readable) image. The scanner can come included and as part of a all-in-one printer or can be bought as a separate flatbed or handheld scanner.
Speaker/headphones: these are output devices, which means they send information from the computer to the user -

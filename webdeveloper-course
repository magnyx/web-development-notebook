  Notes from the Webdeveloper Course by The Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/)

Foundations Course: 
1- Internet, Computer basics
2- Git, GitHub basics
3- Front-end technologies basics (HTML, CSS, Javascript)

Introduction: The Odin Project is an open-source community dedicated to providing the best information sources to take you from zero to (hero) full-stack developer.
Don't skip anything.

  Web development
Introduction: Web developers build and maintain websites.
Clients usually are trying to get their product or service onto the wbe. The work is usually project-focused and involves collaborating with a team to coordinate the client's needs into the end product. The work could involve front-end, back-end ou full-stack web development.

Front end development: the stuff you see on the website in your browser, including the presentation of content ans user interface elements. HTML, CSS, Javascript etc.
Back end development: the guts of the application, which live on the server. Stores and serves program data to ensure that the front end has what it needs. Can become complicated when a website has millions of users. Java, Python, Roby and Javascript to work with data.
Full-stack developers are comfortable workinf with both the front and back ends. This is the focus of The Odin Project, to cover all aspects of web development.

Tools to use regularly: Computer, Google, Text Editor, Command Line Interface (CLI), Stack Overflow, Git, GitHub

Reading assignment: "Why Learning Code is so damn hard" (https://web.archive.org/web/20230630111131/https://www.thinkful.com/blog/why-learning-to-code-is-so-damn-hard/); Wikipedia's take on Web design (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_design); and the blog post from Udacity on front-end, back-end and full stack developers (https://www.udacity.com/blog/2020/12/front-end-vs-back-end-vs-full-stack-web-developers.html).
From these, the most important observations I've found were: 
 1. Learn the basic, and build. Once facing challenges upon, try to collab. Also, always learn from other people's codes on your own. Embrace challenges and don't give up.
 2. Creating a website involves: web designer, web development. But it can (and should) also involve a Graphic designer (logos, layouts, buttons), Internet marketing specialist, SEO writer, Internet copywriter, and User experience (UX) designer. These are all important in the making of an effective website!
 3. For front-end web development, must learn HTML, CSS and Javascript. Also, must be proficient in web frameworks and libraries like Bootstrap, Foundation, AngularJS, ReactJS, and EmberJS. Node.js is also a powerful tool and enhances workflow when using frameworks like ReactJS and AngularJS. Then, must also acquire experience with Ajax (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML). Also, the front-end developer must have a keen eye to detail and creativity.
3.1 Back-end development of a website consists of a server, an application, and a database. To make the server, application, and database communicate, we use languages like Node.js, Go, PHP, Ruby, Python, Java, and .NET. Can also use tools like MySQL, Oracle, and SQL Server to find, save, or change data and serve it back to the user through front-end code. 
Python is favored for its readability and simplicity -> repid development. Java is renowned for its performance and scalability -> ideal for large-scale enterprise applications.
Jobs for back-end developers often require experience with PHP frameworks like Laravel, Symfony, and CakePHP; version control software like Git; and using Linux as development and deployment system. Knowledge on these tools allow back-end developers to create robust, scalable, secure web applications.
3.2 Full stack developers are a jack-of-all-trades. The term was popularized by Facebook's engineering department. They're a full package.

Reading suggestions I caught were:
Hacker news (https://web.archive.org/web/20230630111115/https://news.ycombinator.com/)
[Book] Homepage usability: 50 websites deconstructed (https://archive.org/details/homepageusabilit00jako_0/mode/2up). According to wikipedia, the authors of this book sustain that the homepage of a website is the most important page (2002). Other web developers contest, arguing that most people go straight to the page they intend to through searching engines. But the book looks really cool still!

Learning to Learn
The brain has two "core" modes: the focus mode and the relaxed mode. Navigate through "focus" and "relaxed" mode in a fluid way so you can learn!
